09:02:59 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	I'm 99% certain "kyu" is pronounced "queue"
09:03:14 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	Japanese
09:13:22 From  Emily Wurzler  to  Everyone:
	Where is George #59??
09:13:56 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	haha Emily yes! I only ever get 58 too!
09:14:14 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:
	same
09:14:27 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I can get 59 but havenâ€™t managed to ALSO count movies
09:16:13 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	George #59 is being collapsed into another George if you're grouping on name.
09:16:50 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:
	grrrrrr
09:17:07 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	If you group by person_id you should get that last George
09:17:07 From  Tyler Moloney  to  Everyone:
	the actor and director one got me for a big
09:17:13 From  Tyler Moloney  to  Everyone:
	bit*
09:17:29 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I had to get my wife to come sit with me and work through #21. It was tricky.
09:18:07 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	The 'no-movie' Georges are why we need the Left Join
09:18:38 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	All Georges, Some matching movies.
09:18:43 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Yep. The tricky part for me was that if you count the wrong thing in the movies table, the no movie Georges get a movie.
09:18:45 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	I hold my hands up in the air like a bear and talk to myself when representing left and right tables and my wife thinks im crazy
09:19:00 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	HAHA
09:19:17 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	That is pretty much exactly what I imagined when rejoining the study group convo lol
09:19:29 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	If it works, it's good!
09:19:41 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	hahaha hey yeah it gets the job done!
09:21:32 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	GROUP BY PERSON ID!!!
09:21:35 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	OF COURSE!
09:22:04 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	There are two Georges who have the exact same name. If you group by person name, they merge into a single George.
09:22:45 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	Yeah when you gave that clue it made so much sense. I tried distinct but the person_id makes so much more sense since theyre non-repeatable
09:22:48 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	Tricky George Wallace!
09:24:24 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Ashley the same just happened to me in IJ.
09:25:48 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	What does the 0/1 intelliJ message say?
09:26:52 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I was running into that error where it hits line 12 and errors because line 12 is supposed to be 0 instead of 1.
09:27:02 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Yes thatâ€™s it.
09:27:04 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	Oh yes!
09:27:05 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Exactly.
09:27:35 From  Ashley Hoffmann  to  Everyone:
	Yes, it says it should be 0 but it's actually 1
09:28:54 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	David talked it out faster than I could write it. :)
09:29:15 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	It seemed like several people were having the same question so I wanted to make sure that we didn't move on. :)
09:29:28 From  Ashley Hoffmann  to  Everyone:
	Yep! That worked! Thanks David!!
09:31:26 From  Nema Aragones  to  Everyone:
	thanks David
09:31:47 From  Emily Wurzler  to  Everyone:
	I'm loving this so much. It's so fun lol
09:32:28 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I definitely needed a second brain for this one. I also messed myself up on 15 by adding an unnecessary DISTINCT tag that returned the correct information but imposed an unwritten ORDER BY that caused the test to fail. :)
09:32:28 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	Anyone else get 21 rows for the actors born in 50's and movie in 1985? I even displayed the release dates to check and each row is correct! any ideas?!
09:33:12 From  Dan Schnelzer  to  Everyone:
	did you need select distinct for that one?
09:33:13 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Are you checking for DISTINCT entries, Levi?
09:33:32 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	wow. thought I had haha
09:33:34 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	thanks guys
09:34:11 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Whenever it seems close but not quite right, I add (or remove) DISTINCT to see if that nudges it the rest of the way.
09:34:29 From  Emily Wurzler  to  Everyone:
	Same, David! It solved several problems
09:34:42 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	wow, Tom Hanks strikes again!
09:36:16 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Wilson would be proud.
09:39:33 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	is there an isCannibal column? they may need to add one...
09:40:21 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	INSERT INTO cabin (actual_cannibal) VALUES (shia_lebouf);
09:43:12 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	sounds like postgres needs a garbage collector.
09:43:51 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	That was Macho Cat Randy Savage
09:44:20 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	One of our corgis is prone to ear infections. It's a bad time.
09:53:47 From  Tyler Moloney  to  Everyone:
	stay away from Hawkins National Laboratory
09:54:04 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	And their pumpkin patches
10:13:40 From  Tyler Moloney  to  Everyone:
	that makes much more sense to my brain seeing it that way
10:17:38 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:
	backups are handy
10:22:09 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I am not looking forward to tonight's homework.
10:22:27 From  Nema Aragones  to  Everyone:
	lol me too
10:22:28 From  Ryan Goodchild  to  Everyone:
	That's what i'm thinking
10:22:36 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	maybe these slides can have some inception memes too in the future...
10:23:14 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Can we just look at kittens for a few more minutes??
10:23:39 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	SELECT * FROM kittens
10:24:13 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	LIMIT 0
10:25:19 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	the limit does not exist
10:44:32 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	Oh awesome....
10:45:01 From  Tyler Moloney  to  Everyone:
	the mind flayer tried that
10:45:09 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:

	yea!
10:52:29 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Their strings stay attached! So funny.
10:52:53 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I got sidetracked by it after too many JOIN statements.
11:11:20 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Does group C present in this pathway today?
11:11:32 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	Only on panel days
11:11:55 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
