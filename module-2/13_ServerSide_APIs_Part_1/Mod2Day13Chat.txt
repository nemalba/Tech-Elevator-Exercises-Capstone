09:13:27 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	I really wanted it to be A.
09:26:37 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	It folks are so ornery!
09:29:16 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	get all the money for a kitten!
09:40:33 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	and the reading kept talking about todo.
09:40:43 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	hahaha
09:40:58 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	it's all the Wizard of Oz!
10:18:54 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	Am I right that limited vs delimited is like flammable vs inflammable?
10:19:56 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	not quite. Delimiters do limit - they mark boundaries.		But they're not natural limits unless interpretted
10:21:40 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	I've only seen 'limited' use to define restrictions in a Java context (limited character length, etc.)
10:31:26 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	Another thought on the differences, sparked by Margaret's '?' note: 		Nearly any character sequence can be a delimiter for functions that utilize RegEx, but we have some conventional standardized delimiters and delimiting practices so we can expect specific formats. (e.g. CSV files, : in JSON, white spaces, '?', etc.)
10:40:10 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	Margaret is all of us when we start a screen share
10:40:26 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	nothing works!
10:48:46 From Daniel Blackman (He/Him) To Everyone:
	mine too
10:48:50 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	same here
10:48:57 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	yup
11:30:01 From Daniel Blackman (He/Him) To Everyone:
	reservation.getHotelID
11:41:41 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	none of us have ever gotten confused as to what we were doing.
11:45:17 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	one of the Advent of Code problems taught me about the concurrent iteration-modification issue!
11:52:01 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	I had the same, its because it doesn't match exactly with our method language if you throw a regular // comment ahead of it, it'll go away
11:52:08 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	I came across that in CodeWars @Rigel!
11:52:14 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	Emily, maybe its the return type at the top of the method returning a list of Hotels rather than Reservations?
11:55:22 From Emily Marshall To Everyone:
	Yup! That was it, Ryan. Thanks!
