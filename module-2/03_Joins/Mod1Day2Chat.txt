	SQL is elegant in that way that it reads so simply without any sort of syntactic bologna
10:59:31 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	It is super nice that SQL (at least so far) reads very much like regular English
10:59:39 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	exactly!
11:04:43 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	I feel like this is another comfort that will eventually be taken away from us. :)

12:01:56 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	haha that's a great scene!
12:01:58 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
