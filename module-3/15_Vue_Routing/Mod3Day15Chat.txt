09:09:05 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Thinking about the word from just a word perspective. I don't think I want an unshit function.
09:09:06 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Rigel beat me to the joke. I was going to say that when I write my own programming language, .unshit will just fix all your errors automatically and make your code better.
09:10:18 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	...Sam, I'm dying here considering that function
09:27:47 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:

09:29:55 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Sam!!
09:30:29 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:

09:30:42 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	this is the way
09:30:42 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:

09:35:09 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	We had joked that Margaret was definitely going to call on us. It's amazing to be SO right.
09:43:01 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Daniel B. nailed this one.
09:43:25 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	Team effort!
09:44:16 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	You and your wife make a cute couple, Levi!
09:44:53 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	haha why thank you!!
09:51:25 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:

10:00:03 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:
	20 lines minimum
10:01:02 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	I've seen some dizzyingly complex codewars solutions.
10:03:00 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Stop looking at my solutions, Sam!
