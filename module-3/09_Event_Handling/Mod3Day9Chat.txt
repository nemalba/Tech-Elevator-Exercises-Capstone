09:00:40 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	Sounds like a rogue curly brace.
09:01:24 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	That worked for me. I copied their code over my code and the last part that wasn't working for me started working.
09:01:52 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	It was user error on my side but I definitely couldn't figure out what I did wrong. :)
09:03:00 From Nick Schultz (he/him) To Everyone:
	CONGRATS!
09:05:56 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Cake for everyone!
09:11:20 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	Margaret is laughing because my energy is down after a night of fitful dreams involving JavaScript DOM modification.
09:26:07 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	Margaret youre so kind
09:26:09 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	I am so ready to meet those expectations!
09:26:24 From Alida Smith To Everyone:

09:26:42 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	im going to be tired of hearing myself talk on tuesday
09:27:01 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	David those may be expectations I can meet!
09:29:28 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	oh I didn't know it was by module
09:29:54 From Nick Schultz (he/him) To Everyone:
	I did not know that either
09:30:01 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	I think Joe may be worried about me, but not for my grades.
09:30:31 From Joe Righetti To Everyone:
	ðŸ˜‚
09:30:47 From Joe Righetti To Everyone:
	Not after I saw your ugly webpage!
09:30:51 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Is there a JS function for that?
09:31:05 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	function findJob() {}
09:33:07 From Nick Schultz (he/him) To Everyone:
	Alternatively I like to use the winLottery() function
09:34:02 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	world.addEventListener('click', (event) => {	    let jobSearch = document.getElementById('opportunity');	    jobSearch.innerText = 'Rebecca is Hired!';	});
09:35:43 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	Anyone here remember the movie The Lawnmower Man? I was joking with someone the other day that after this course I am the lawnmower man, and my "birth cry" will be every inbox in the world receiving a copy of my resume
09:36:39 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:

09:56:53 From Daniel Blackman (He/Him) To Everyone:
	And uphill both ways!
09:56:56 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	"Back in my day....."
09:57:06 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	I hate coding UpHill
09:57:28 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	Joe had to do all his assignments on paper and mail them in. It was a rough time.
09:57:39 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:

09:57:58 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	Git Push USPS mail
09:58:31 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:

09:58:42 From Joe Righetti To Everyone:
	hahahaha
09:59:11 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	I'm sure he remembers chiseling code into stone tablets.
09:59:27 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	wouldn't it technically be a suffix? haha
09:59:37 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	misplaced curly brace, back to the quarry
10:00:19 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	omg Ren and Stimpy. Talk about a show NONE of us should've been watching as children haha
10:00:53 From Emily Marshall To Everyone:
	lol, I wasn't allowed to watch Captain America, but my parents were somehow cool with Ren and Stimpy
10:01:17 From Emily Marshall To Everyone:
	Oops, I meant Captain Planet
10:01:52 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	lmao why they mad at captain planet???
10:01:55 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	ðŸ˜®
10:02:22 From Emily Marshall To Everyone:
	Environmentalist propaganda lol
10:02:45 From Alida Smith To Everyone:

10:06:12 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	i'd +1 that
10:12:41 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:

10:16:03 From Emily Marshall To Everyone:
	lol
10:29:53 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Uphill all day.
10:30:09 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Weâ€™ll all be replaced by robots soon anyway ...
10:30:38 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	not if we creating the robots
10:31:34 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	is that module 4?
10:32:11 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	haha on graduation we get plugged into the Matrix
10:32:22 From David Siebold To Everyone:
	Is that an option, Rebecca? Can I just stay at Tech Elevator in class forever?
10:32:31 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	I wish!
10:32:33 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	Actually david, on graduation they pull us out.
10:32:39 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Student4Ever
10:32:40 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	Oh dan said that.
10:35:05 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	There's a bootcamp for Sr. developers called Interview Kickstart. They focus on data structures and algorithms, and their selling point is getting you a job that doubles your current salary.
10:35:14 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	I don't think we've linked the js yet?
10:35:59 From Daniel Blackman (He/Him) To Everyone:
	I think he's right
10:36:21 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	And to Rebecca's point there is a new thing called GitHub Copilot that DOES auto-write a lot of code
10:40:23 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	I'm suspicious of any program that isn't transparent about costs! TE lays it out so openly and consistently.
10:44:02 From Daniel Blackman (He/Him) To Everyone:
	try rebeccaPurple!
10:54:27 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	A good ugly-website strategy would be to create an "onMouseOver" event for a button, so it does something before you even click it
10:54:55 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	There is a CSS hover effect you can use for that!
10:55:09 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Seems like thatâ€™s a type of event listener in its own right.
10:55:40 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	I still catch myself chuckling from time to time at Sam's site, and some of his user-unfriendly features
10:56:18 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	it worked for me
10:57:05 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	I can't stand sitting.
10:57:22 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	For more frustrating web design: userinyerface.com
11:11:25 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	Tyler, that was beautiful.
11:11:39 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	probably not the word I'd use, but sure
11:12:09 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	planned chaos.  I loved it.
11:16:29 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Thank you!!!
11:17:26 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	This is great because now itâ€™s easier to go to review session with Joshua tomorrow too!
11:17:39 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	^^
11:18:30 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	Yeah, definitely had to make choices between review and pair exercises on pair exercises before
11:18:38 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	I am still surprised I didn't see a "Bootstrap's bootstraps" reference.
11:25:15 From John Matthews To Everyone:
	www.webdevelopersnotes.com/browswer-list
11:46:23 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	that would be annoying on a real site! I always move my cursor away from the text editor.
11:46:35 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	I used blur and that behavior feels good
11:46:44 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	yeah!
11:50:38 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	But we PULLED the rabbit out of the hat.
12:01:56 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
