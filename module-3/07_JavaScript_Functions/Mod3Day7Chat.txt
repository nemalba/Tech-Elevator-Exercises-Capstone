08:55:42 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Morning all!
08:56:01 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Good morning!
08:57:37 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	That's actually a really interesting point.
09:05:09 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	it helps encapsulate!
09:19:18 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I am FOR SURE going to give some weird answers. :)
09:19:22 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	"Don't be weird, Rebecca..."
09:20:02 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	Doe normaal!
09:20:37 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Thank you for that sidebar, Margaret! There is so much to process.
09:20:47 From  Ryan Goodchild  to  Everyone:
	^
09:26:15 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	unless you are Andy and set the string variable equal to the same thing.
09:26:16 From  Ryan Goodchild  to  Everyone:
	Andy actually gave me that String comparison with == as a trick question
09:26:50 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	hash values.
09:29:23 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I would preface everything with that statement!!!
09:30:16 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Fake it til you become it is my favorite TedTalk.
09:32:44 From  Ashley Hoffmann  to  Everyone:
	Great thought, Rebecca!
09:33:10 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Yeah, there's a cost in time and money to do interviews. I would have been thrilled if every pharmacy technician I interviewed was excellent from the start.
09:33:34 From  Dan Schnelzer  to  Everyone:
	good point david
09:35:47 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	That last question was a 50-50 for me... fun to see it got 50%.
09:35:58 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I was very grumpy about the last question but I made my peace with it.
09:36:14 From  Dan Schnelzer  to  Everyone:
	50% chance = 100% you get it wrong ha
09:36:28 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	I thought I don't know was the right answer here.
09:36:38 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Every question is 50/50! I either get it right or wrong! :)
09:38:40 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I submit to the jury: line 2 should be a correct answer.
09:38:47 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	agreed
09:38:51 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	I forward that motion
09:39:11 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	That's what I said too. But I see why it's line 4.
09:39:28 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	why 2? Because that's the origin of the constant? It would run, but the assignment in 4 causes the issue
09:39:31 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	yea 4 causes the error... 2 is how to fix the error..
09:39:41 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	yes!!
09:39:44 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	ah
09:39:48 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Exactly. I'm still a little grumpy about it...
09:40:17 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	OUR error was on line 2.
09:40:20 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	The program fails on 4.
09:40:22 From  Ryan Goodchild  to  Everyone:
	It's a zero sum game
09:40:35 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Our error was in picking line 2 as the answer.
09:40:39 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	yeah. I was looking for 'what will not run or cause an error'
09:42:01 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	but line two doesn't inherently cause an error
09:42:33 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	exactly
09:42:37 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	Whose quiz is it anyway!
09:42:37 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	It just hurts my soul a little. No big deal.
09:42:52 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Daniel that's gold.
09:43:52 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	so go faster, slowly.
09:43:53 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I find the chat to be surprisingly valuable and it makes me think whispering during class in grade school should be have been allowed.
09:44:10 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Sam, hahaha.
09:44:12 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:
	It was allowed. They just taught us to not get caught. :)
09:44:22 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	meta-lessons
09:46:37 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	My debugger IS sout.
09:46:37 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I console log everything to debug as I’m coding.
09:46:46 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	David, exactly!
09:46:50 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I feel bad for all the people that coded as my partner that had to deal with a million souts.
09:47:16 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	David we pushed intelliJ to its sout limits!
09:47:45 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	IntelliJ had it coming...
09:47:51 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:
	lol
09:48:47 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	What if I told you, I am a huge matrix fan and still haven't seen the new movie.
09:49:00 From  Dan Schnelzer  to  Everyone:
	right there with u sam!
09:49:16 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I'd say you're not missing much. Go in with low expectations and you'll still be entertained.
09:49:34 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't have the same magic.
09:49:38 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	That's almost exactly my expectations.
09:49:54 From  Dan Schnelzer  to  Everyone:
	lets get weird
09:49:58 From  Alida Smith  to  Everyone:
	Its... different
09:53:38 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	This graphic doesn’t account for TDD does it?
09:55:43 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	I think you could say it does by putting design/development.  The graphic just has it later.
09:55:51 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	oops. earlier.
09:56:21 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	so for each of them just move where test is and it could be TDD.  But I could be way off!
09:56:42 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	That makes sense to me!
10:01:36 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	"Report your blockages!"
10:02:23 From  Daniel Blackman (He/Him)  to  Everyone:
	Omega star STILL hasn't gotten their ISO time stamps yet, we are BLOCKED
10:02:46 From  Ryan Goodchild  to  Everyone:
	That was a great video
10:20:26 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	I AM counting on Tech Elevator to live the rest of my life for me.
10:20:49 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Is there like a TE probation officer?
10:34:31 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I had a problem too but refresh worked.
10:42:39 From  Emily Marshall  to  Everyone:
	none of this is working for me
10:47:33 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Emily I have to refresh after every update for some reason.
10:47:47 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	(Update == every time we change demo.js)
10:48:24 From  Emily Marshall  to  Everyone:
	Nope. Still not working. Super frustrating
11:01:07 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	I want that T-shirt!
11:07:13 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	I am slightly disgruntled that .map is different from a map.
11:25:02 From  Rebecca Palmore  to  Everyone:
	Node is awesome.
11:42:24 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	age is a word.
11:53:49 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	we already knew that answer.
11:54:31 From  David Siebold  to  Everyone:
	Hah. I was going to suffer whether she helped me or not.
