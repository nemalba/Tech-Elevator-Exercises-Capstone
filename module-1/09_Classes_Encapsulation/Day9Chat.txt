09:00:01 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	Refactoring the curriculum?
09:00:15 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	What were the typos?
09:00:46 From Daniel Blackman To Everyone:
	String curriculumChanges = "Hi it's me again " + changeNeeded
09:00:59 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	hah!
09:10:29 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	I like how Margaret is scattering the Key-Value pairs all over the screen to drive home its unorderedness
09:21:44 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	im weird. the peterpaul were the easy ones to me.
09:22:06 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	That's great!
09:23:02 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	Thanks Rigel. ‚ù§Ô∏è
09:23:30 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	Even the messed-up integer math resulting in a value unequal to what the test case was checking for?
09:23:58 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	ha gabe! true!
09:24:33 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	I made an integer called roundingError that = 1 if money % 2 != 0
09:24:51 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	I had to do something similar
09:25:03 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	I definitely had to check what the test was looking for.  then casted.
09:26:01 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	those tests were screwing. the nulls took me out.
09:26:15 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	**screwy
09:35:30 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	Gabe same here! I eventually just got frustrated and added an initial if that check for modulo 2 and if not I added one to the result and that fixed it haha
09:36:01 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	"are you sure this test didn't pass?"
09:36:06 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	ü§£ü§£ü§£
09:36:36 From Odgerel Jamsranjav To Everyone:
	IntelliJ : Yes.I'm sure
09:36:48 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	LOL
09:43:50 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	But if it's on the internet it has to be true!
10:13:03 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	big shout outs to the debugger
10:23:26 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	after 100 tabs in chrome, the count is just an excited face		:D
10:23:49 From David Siebold (He/Him) To Everyone:
	100 tabs! üòÖ
10:25:58 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	I just checked mine, sitting at 37.
10:26:40 From David Siebold (He/Him) To Everyone:
	üò≤ I get agitated if I'm approaching 10.
10:28:55 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	Grouping tabs is a lifesaver/ enabler.
10:44:51 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	bless you?
10:45:55 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	I think cause the return is in the getter, it looks like a setter. this would have confused me later
10:46:17 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	wait...did I say that backwards
10:46:21 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	i think of set as setting something equal to
10:46:40 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	getters return. you're right alida
10:46:42 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	Ashley, the order in which the getters and setters are recorded inside the class does not matter, but the order in which they are called by some other program or method may matter a lot
10:47:29 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	so good practice is setter than getter
10:52:21 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	Alida, like Margaret mentioned, this is all just creating a template for our project well write. So order isn't all that important as long as they exist and can be referenced
11:07:23 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	thanks Levi
11:07:39 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	üëç
11:08:09 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	10 pushups every break!
11:23:15 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	Good practice Sam! Physical activity has been shown to enhance creating new memories
11:25:00 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Whoops. I misread as ‚Äú10 cookies.‚Äù
11:25:12 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	haha!
11:25:32 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	hahah
11:26:14 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	1  cookie between each pushup.
11:26:34 From Rebecca Palmore To Everyone:
	Hmm. Last and final offer?
11:26:48 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	oh, merely a suggestion.
11:32:09 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	Gabe I appreciate the extra comments and questions.  Always nice to hear things a slightly different way.
11:34:32 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	Yes! I hope no one thinks they speak too much. Every thought and question is valuable! 		Margaret is sure to pull us aside if not. :)
11:51:39 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	üëç
11:55:01 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	the chemE in me really appreciates the molecular modeling examples
