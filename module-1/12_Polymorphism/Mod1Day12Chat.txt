09:06:47 From David Siebold (He/Him) To Everyone:
	Yeah, I did mostly 8's too but there was a 6 that captured my imagination and I went all the way through it.
09:08:22 From David Siebold (He/Him) To Everyone:
	It also takes away all the excellent help that IntelliJ gives you. Found that challenging at first.
09:11:03 From Nema Aragones To Everyone:
	Codewars is like HackerRank?
09:11:31 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	I think so Nema, I haven't done it but Andy said it was similar at the bottom of his post
09:13:54 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:

09:34:00 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	I didn't get to do my daily pulse.  I am curious as to what constructor we need to make for the children classes.
09:35:05 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	child class needs to have same parameters as parent I believe
09:35:17 From nick schultz To Everyone:
	Sorry I woke up 5 min before class! Still half asleep
09:35:37 From Sam Stauffer To Everyone:
	so if 2 constructors in parent, 2 in child no matter what?
09:36:03 From Dan Schnelzer To Everyone:
	you can add more but Need to have the same as the parent at least
09:51:43 From Emily Wurzler To Everyone:
	That's what happened to me, Margaret! I have no internet at home and had to run to a coffee shop
09:59:31 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	Nema 👍

	As you can probably tell from behind me, my wife buys ALL OF THE BOOKS!
10:05:28 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	It's hard to tell from a distance, but at least one of the shelves behind me is 'we MAKE all of the books!'

10:33:38 From Levi Wolfe To Everyone:
	Interface time!
10:56:14 From Gabe Humphreys To Everyone:
	That's why System.in is a Scanner Interface
10:56:32 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	And Lists!
10:57:08 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	crunch
10:57:10 From Ryan Goodchild To Everyone:
	have to ask Newton
10:57:18 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:

11:30:39 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	89
11:30:41 From Tyler Moloney To Everyone:
	turquoise
11:30:47 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	oh my
11:34:33 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	so implements will always include an override method
11:34:57 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	or interfaces rather
11:36:06 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	Alida: the classes that implement interfaces will always have Overrided methods
11:36:23 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	but the interface itself has those empty abstract methods
11:36:47 From Alida Smith To Everyone:
	ooh. I was on my wrong screen. I see
11:46:20 From Rigel Richardson To Everyone:
	The Tractor is A Tractor object and is a Singable object
