08:55:28 From  David Siebold (He/Him)  to  Everyone:

09:09:21 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	James you have another question?
09:09:33 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	or are you pulling a Levi?
09:09:57 From  Levi Wolfe  to  Everyone:
	hahah I deserve that
09:18:28 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:

09:23:12 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Maybe I fat fingered one, but I thought I answered A,D,E and got it wrong...
09:27:10 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Oh it was this one I got wrong because of the closing... oops
09:48:33 From  Rigel Richardson  to  Everyone:

09:50:56 From  Ryan Goodchild  to  Everyone:

10:04:05 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	why com/techelevator and not com.techelevator?
10:05:22 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:
	because techelevator is a directory inside the com directory, and when entering the file path you have to use the syntax the OS understands, which is forwardslash
10:05:39 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	Ah makes sense thanks Gabe!
10:17:39 From  Gabe Humphreys  to  Everyone:

	Absolutely!
10:42:06 From  Tyler Moloney  to  Everyone:
	What fixed it Emily?
10:43:32 From  Sam Stauffer  to  Everyone:
	she did not type into her text file.  Therefore it returned 0 bytes as her size.
